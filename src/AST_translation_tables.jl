## Things that can't be loaded twice.g
# Some instances of data structures

## Symbol correspondence/translation between Julia and SJulia

# This should be separated better. Some symbols are translated
# only on analyzing the ast, others, on both input and output.
# Fix. We delete the keys we don't want (unicode) from the reverse translation.

#### Input,Output translation table.

# These translations are made when encountered in the AST and on printing.
# A reversed dict is constructed for output.
# Excepted are the unicode characters. They are merged into the input dict.
# But, they are held in a separate table for output, so that unicode
# output can be disabled.

# Idea, but not implemented:
# We could use  a.b for contexts, modules.  In Mma
# a . b == a.b  == Dot[a,b], matrix and vector multiplication.
# a`b is symbol b in context a.  a .* b is illegal in Mma, but a .* b is legal syntax in Julia
# So: in SJulia  a.b for contexts,  and a .* b for matrix multiplication
